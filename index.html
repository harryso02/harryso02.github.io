        <p class="quote">Harry is one of the most outstanding interns that I have worked with.
          Among all the projects he had participated in, he demonstrated his creative
          yet resilient mindset in front of others, which has always impressed me
          and the team. From innovating new ideas to putting things into practice,
          he has been critically thinking from all possible perspectives, making
          him a shining person among his peers. I wish he could continue develop
          both his soft and hard skills, and wish him all the best in his future
          endeavours.
